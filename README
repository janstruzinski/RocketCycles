Hi,

Welcome to RocketCycles. It is a python library dedicated to staged combustion rocket engine cycles. It
allows to both analyse them for given arguments and size them for given constraints in order to get combustion chamber
performance, pressure ratio of the turbines or pressure rise in the pumps, crossflow massflows etc.

cycle_functions.py stores functions representing pumps, turbines, preburners, combustion chambers. They can be
assembled together into a staged combustion rocket engine cycle.

fluid.py stores RocketCycleFluid class that conveniently allows to store data about propellants or
preburner products, as well as to get their thermophysical properties using NASA 9 polynomials or real gas density
using PyFluids (wrapper about CoolProp).

cycle_classes.py stores definitions of classes representing different staged combustion rocket engine cycles. Cycle
class is a parent class with shared attributes and methods. FFSC_LRE, ORSC_LRE, CC_LRE are subclasses containing
analysis functions specific to these cycles. These can be used as inspiration if you want to assemble your own closed
cycle. CycleSizing allows to size any of the cycles above for given arguments.

examples.py shows how to call these classes and perform the analysis.

tests.py stores unit tests for the package.

It is highly recommened that you see the code, so that you know what is happening under the hood and are aware of any
assumptions.

For installation, first install nasaPoly from https://github.com/ptgodart/nasaPoly.git

To add JP-10 and RP-1, find raw.dat in nasaPoly installation directory and add the following data to other species:

JP-10(L)          Exo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene. Smith,1979.

To install RocketCycles, do:
pip3 install git+https://github.com/janstruzinski/RocketCycles.git

I hope you will find the library useful!

Cheers,
